## Description

This graduate-level course covers the quantum effect in solids, such as the phenomena related to topological phases of matter. We cover the following topics:

1. Semiclassical approach
2. Emerging dynamics of quasiparticles (beyond Newton's Law)
3. Geometric phase, Chern number, and fiber bundle
4. Quantum Hall insulator—a topological phase of matter
5. Interaction bosonic superfluid
6. Quantum 1D Ising model and symmetry breaking
7. Critical point in 1D Ising model and its dual free fermion model
8. Topological superconductors
9. Half-qubits—Majorana zero modes
10. K-theory for symmetry protected topological phases of free fermions
11. \\(Z_2\\) topological order for 2D interacting bosons
12. Emergent fermions and string operators
13. Topological order and long range entanglement
14. Higher category theory for topological excitations

## Textbook and Notes

There is no assigned textbook for this course. Instead, detailed {{% resource_link "1273c21d-feb5-47bf-84d9-bd257ca65a78" "lecture notes" %}} are provided in the form of slide presentations used in class.

## Requirements

There are weekly problem set assignments, due on Thursday at lecture. There is also a term paper.
